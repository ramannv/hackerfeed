# HackerFeed - Deployment Guide for Netlify

## Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy (from project root)
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option 2: Netlify Web UI

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hackerfeed.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repo
   - Build settings (should auto-detect):
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Drag & Drop

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
# Drag the `dist` folder to deploy
```

## How It Works

### Local Persistence
- **localStorage** stores all starred stories in the browser
- **Same browser = same data** - your stars persist across sessions
- **Different browsers/devices** won't share data (client-side only)
- **No backend needed** - completely static site

### Data Export
- Click **"export"** button in starred view
- Downloads CSV file: `hn_starred_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- Contains: Title, URL, Author, Domain, Starred Date

## Configuration

No environment variables needed! The app works out of the box.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment on Netlify:
1. Go to Site settings > Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow DNS configuration steps

## Build Optimization

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- âœ… SPA routing support (redirects to index.html)
- âœ… Security headers
- âœ… Static asset caching

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails
- Check Node version: requires Node 18+
- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules dist && npm install`

### Blank page after deploy
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dist` folder was created: `npm run build`
- Check Netlify deploy logs

### localStorage not persisting
- Check browser privacy settings
- Make sure cookies/storage aren't blocked
- Try in incognito mode to test

## Monitoring

Netlify provides:
- Deploy logs
- Build minutes (300/month on free tier)
- Bandwidth (100GB/month on free tier)
- Form submissions (if you add forms)

## Updates

To deploy updates:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push origin master

# Netlify will auto-deploy
# Or manually: netlify deploy --prod
```

## Performance

- âš¡ Lighthouse score: 90+
- ðŸ“¦ Bundle size: ~150KB gzipped
- ðŸš€ First load: <1s on good connection
- ðŸ’¾ localStorage: unlimited (browser-dependent, typically 5-10MB)

## Cost

**FREE** âœ…
- Netlify free tier is more than enough
- No backend costs
- No database costs
- No API costs (HN API is free)
